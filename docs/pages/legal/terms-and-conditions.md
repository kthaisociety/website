## Clauses

### 1.Object

By virtue of this agreement, the Participant or Attendee agrees to participate in the corresponding event organised by KTHAIS.

This T&C apply to both the Participants and the Attendees, although some of its clauses may only be applicable to the Participant given their role in the event.

KTHAIS is an association that promotes technology, creativity and innovation and organises events, primarily related with Artificial Intelligence.

### 2.Code of Conduct

This is the Code of Conduct that we expect all KTHack participants to abide. This is a customised version of the Code of Conduct used at MLH member hackathons. If you have a suggestion for this code of conduct or a question about them, please let us know.

#### TL;DR

Be respectful. Harassment and abuse are never tolerated.

#### The Code of Conduct

At KTHAIS we believe that every participant has the right to hack in a safe and welcoming environment.

Harassment includes but is not limited to offensive verbal or written comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, social class, economic status, veteran status, sexual images, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. If what you’re doing is making someone feel uncomfortable, that counts as harassment and is enough reason to stop doing it.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Sponsors, judges, mentors, organisers, and anyone else at the event are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, attendees should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material both in their hacks and during the event. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, KTHAIS may take any action it deems appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event with no eligibility for reimbursement or refund of any type.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact KTHAIS using the reporting procedures defined below.

Event organizers will be happy to help participants contact campus security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your attendance.

We expect participants to follow these rules at all event venues, online interactions in relation to the event and on event supplied transportation.

#### Reporting procedures

If you feel uncomfortable or think there may be a potential violation of the Code of Conduct, please report it immediately using one of the following methods. All reporters have the right to remain anonymous.

By sending us an email to [contact@kthack.com](mailto:contact@kthack.com), your report will be received by our organisers. If you want to remain anonymous please send us an email through an anonymous email service or create a temporary email account.

If you need to contact a team member directly, please contact one of our organisers below.

* Filip Matz, @Filip in Slack, [filip@kthack.com](mailto:filip@kthack.com).

KTHAIS reserves the right to revise, make exceptions to, or otherwise amend these policies in whole or in part.

### 3.Cheating reponse procedure

#### Procedure

The following is a guide of actions to be taken in the case of an accusation that a team cheated or otherwise violated the rules of competition.

Accusations of cheating may include but are not limited to the following.

* A team using somebody else's code.
* A team misrepresenting the work they did.
* A team having too many team members.
* A team using code that was written outside the event.

#### Accusation

If you suspect cheating, please get in touch with the organisers of the event. If you are still at the event, please talk to an event organiser. If it is after the event, please email [contact@kthack.com](mailto:contact@kthack.com).

#### Document the report

The following steps are to be followed by KTHAIS.

Try to get as much of the allegation in written form by the reporter. If you cannot, transcribe it yourself as it was told to you.

The important information to gather include the following.

* Identifying information (name, email, phone, etc.) of the reporter.
* Identifying information (name, email, phone, etc.) of the participant/team accused of cheating.
* Reason the reporter suspects cheating.
* Other people suspected to be involved in the cheating.
* Other witnesses/people who suspect the cheating.
* Any relevant URLs (for example GitHub repositories).

KTHAIS organisers will then investigate the allegation by reviewing public materials about the hack, including project repositories, project submissions and anything else available to them.

#### Response

##### A.Cheating did not occur

If KTHAIS determines cheating did not occur, they will compile a report and inform the reporter.

##### B.Other outcomes

If KTHAIS is unable to determine that cheating did not occur based on publicly available resources, organizers will then communicate with the alleged cheater. Informing them of what has been reported about them. Allow the alleged cheater to give their side of the story to the staff. After this point, if the report stands, let the alleged cheater know what actions will be taken against them.

##### Actions that organisers will consider when dealing with alleged cheating offenders

The following actions will be considered.

* Warning the cheater to cease their behavior and that any further reports will result in sanctions.
* Not allowing the participants to demo.
* Not allowing the participants to win prizes.
* Revocation of prizes and recognitions.
* Banning the participants from future events (either indefinitely or for a certain time period).
* Publishing an account of the cheating.

Depending on the cheating allegation, KTHAIS may decide to make one or more public announcements. If necessary, this will be done with a short announcement. No one other than KTHAIS board should make any announcements.

If some attendees were angered by the cheating, it is best to apologise to them that the cheating occurred to begin with.

### 4.Termination and cancellation

KTHAIS may at any time, in its sole discretion, immediately terminate this Agreement with or without cause. KTHAIS will make commercially reasonable efforts to notify the Participant or Attendee via email of any such termination or cancellation up to the date of the event.
